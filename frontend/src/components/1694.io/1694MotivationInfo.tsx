                  We're heading into the age of Voltaire, laying down the
                  foundations for decentralized decision-making. This CIP
                  describes a mechanism for on-chain governance that will
                  underpin the Voltaire phase of Cardano. The CIP builds on and
                  extends the original Cardano governance scheme that was based
                  on a fixed number of governance keys. It aims to provide a
                  first step that is both valuable and, importantly, is also
                  technically achievable in the near term as part of the
                  proposed Voltaire governance system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It also seeks to act as a jumping-off point for continuing
                  community input, including on appropriate threshold settings
                  and other on-chain settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subsequent proposals may adapt and extend this proposal to
                  meet emerging governance needs.

                <p>
                  The on-chain Cardano governance mechanism that was introduced
                  in the Shelley ledger era is capable of:
                </p>
                <ul className="ml-5 mt-2 flex list-decimal flex-col gap-2">
                  <li>
                    modifying the values of the protocol parameters (including
                    initiating "hard forks")
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    transferring Ada out of the reserves and the treasury (and
                    also moving Ada between the reserves and the treasury)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In the current scheme, governance actions are initiated by
                  special transactions that require Quorum-Many authorizations
                  from the governance keys (5 out of 7 on the Cardano mainnet)1.
                  Fields in the transaction body provide details of the proposed
                  governance action: either i) protocol parameter changes; or
                  ii) initiating funds transfers. Each transaction can trigger
                  both kinds of governance actions, and a single action can have
                  more than one effect (e.g. changing two or more protocol
                  parameters).

                One of the protocol parameters is sufficiently significant to
                merit special attention: changing the major protocol version
                enables Cardano to enact controlled hard forks. This type of
                protocol parameter update therefore has a special status, since
                stake pools must upgrade their nodes so they can support the new
                protocol version once the hard fork is enacted.

                Shortcomings of the Shelley governance design
              </p>
              <p>
                The Shelley governance design was intended to provide a simple,
                transitional approach to governance. This proposal aims to
                address a number of shortcomings with that design that are
                apparent as we move into Voltaire.
              </p>
              <ul className="ml-5 mt-2 flex list-decimal flex-col gap-2">
                <li>
                  The Shelley governance design gives no room for active
                  on-chain participation of Ada holders. While changes to the
                  protocol are usually the results of discussions with selected
                  community actors, the process is currently driven mainly by
                  the founding entities. Ensuring that everyone can voice their
                  concern is cumbersome, and can be perceived as arbitrary at
                  times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Movements from the treasury constitute a critical and
                  sensitive topic. However, they can be hard to track. It is
                  important to have more transparency and more layers of control
                  over these movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While they need to be treated specially by SPOs, hard forks
                  are not differentiated from other protocol parameter changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, while there is currently a somewhat common vision for
                  Cardano that is shared by its founding entities and also by
                  many community members, there is no clearly defined document
                  where these guiding principles are recorded. It makes sense to
                  leverage the Cardano blockchain to record the shared Cardano
                  ethos in an immutable fashion, as a formal Cardano
                  Constitution.
