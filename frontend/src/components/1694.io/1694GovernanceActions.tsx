              governance action is an on-chain event that is triggered by a

                An action is said to be ratified when it gathers enough votes in
                its favor (through the rules and parameters that are detailed
                below).

              Any Ada holder can submit a governance action to the chain. They
              must provide a deposit of govActionDeposit Lovelace, which will be
              returned when the action is finalized (whether it is ratified or
              has expired). The deposit amount will be added to the deposit pot,
              similar to stake key deposits. It will also be counted towards the
              stake of the reward address it will be paid back to, to not reduce
              the submitter's voting power to vote on their own (and competing)
              actions.

            <p>
              Governance actions are ratified through on-chain voting actions.
              Different kinds of governance actions have different ratification
              requirements but always involve two of the three governance
              bodies, with the exception of a hard-fork initiation and
              security-relevant protocol parameters, which requires ratification
              by all governance bodies. Depending on the type of governance
              action, an action will thus be ratified when a combination of the
              following occurs:
            </p>
            <ul className="ml-5 flex list-disc flex-col gap-2">
              <li>
                the constitutional committee approves of the action (the number
                of members who vote Yes meets the threshold of the
                constitutional committee)
              </li>
              <li>
                the DReps approve of the action (the stake controlled by the

              </li>
              <li>
                the SPOs approve of the action (the stake controlled by the SPOs
                who vote Yes meets a certain threshold over the total delegated
                active stake for the epoch).

            <p>
              A successful motion of no-confidence, update of the constitutional
              committee, a constitutional change, or a hard-fork, delays
              ratification of all other governance actions until the first epoch
              after their enactment. This gives an updated constitutional
              committee enough time to vote on current proposals, re-evaluate
              existing proposals with respect to a new constitution, and ensures
              that the in principle arbitrary semantic changes caused by
              enacting a hard-fork do not have unintended consequences in
              combination with other actions.

              Each of these thresholds is a governance parameter. There is one
              additional threshold, Q5, related to security relevant protocol
              parameters, which is explained below. The initial thresholds
              should be chosen by the Cardano community as a whole. All
              thresholds for the Info action are set to 100% since setting it
              any lower would result in not being able to poll above the
              threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some parameters are relevant to security properties of the system.
              Any proposal attempting to change such a parameter requires an
              additional vote of the SPOs, with the threshold Q5.

              Governance actions are enacted in order of acceptance to the
              chain. This resolves conflicts where, e.g. there are two competing
              parameter changes.

            <p>
              Governance actions are checked for ratification only on an epoch
              boundary. Once ratified, actions are staged for enactment.
            </p>
            <p>All submitted governance actions will therefore either:</p>

              The governance credential witness will trigger the appropriate
              verifications in the ledger according to the existing UTxOW ledger
              rule (i.e. a signature check for verification keys, and a
              validator execution with a specific vote redeemer and new Plutus
              script purpose for scripts).
            </p>
            <p>
              Votes can be cast multiple times for each governance action by a
              single credential. Correctly submitted votes override any older
              votes for the same credential and role. That is, the voter may
              change their position on any action if they choose. As soon as a
              governance action is ratified, voting ends and transactions
              containing further votes are invalid.

              When a governance action is successfully submitted to the chain,
              its progress will be tracked by the ledger state. In particular,
              the following will be tracked:
            </p>
            <ul className="ml-5 flex list-disc flex-col gap-2">
              <li>the governance action ID</li>

              <li>the deposit amount</li>
              <li>
                the rewards address that will receive the deposit when it is

                committee for this action
              </li>

                the total 'Yes'/'No'/'Abstain' votes of the DReps for this
                action

              <li>
                the total 'Yes'/'No'/'Abstain' votes of the SPOs for this action

            <p>
              Since the stake snapshot changes at each epoch boundary, a new
              tally must be calculated when each unratified governance action is
              checked for ratification. This means that an action could be
              enacted even though the DRep or SPO votes have not changed (since
              the vote delegation could have changed).

                Lovelace contained in a transaction output is considered active
